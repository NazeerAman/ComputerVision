# 📸 OpenCV V1.0 – Basic Image Processing with Python

## 📝 Description

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the foundational operations of image processing using **OpenCV**, one of the most powerful libraries for computer vision. It serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to how images can be loaded, displayed, and saved using Python.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Read images from local storage  
- Display images in a notebook environment  
- Save modified images to disk  
- Learn how OpenCV handles image files (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`)  
- Hands-on code with comments for clarity

## 🛠️ Installation

Make sure Python is installed, then install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

Or use:
